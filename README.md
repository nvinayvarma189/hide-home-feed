# Hide-home-feed
A chrome extension to hide the home feed for social media websites.

## Why to hide the feed?
Social Media is great but addictive. I Often block every social media website altogether. Sometimes to not waste time and sometimes because of its noise.

By noise I mean, too many (strong) opinions and clickbaits. Although I try to follow topics/people very selectively, I still see 90% noise. 10% of the content is truly amazing.

However, I would eventually unblock them because I require social media to connect with people and keep myself updated.

Finally, it struck me that most of the noise comes from the feeds. I just need to block the home feed and I would still be able to view content when I need to. That sounded just about right.

## Why this extension?

There are already some good extensions that do this. But I wanted minor customizations. Also, I've always been curious about how chrome extensions are built. I'm a huge extensions fan. So I thought I'll learn the basics atleast.

## What does it do?

When this chrome extension is installed, it will redirect all requests that are going to `reddit.com` and `reddit.com/r/*` pages to `google.com`. Individual reddit posts are allowed.

## Usage

It is yet to be published in the marketplace. I didn't want to. But if you really want to use it :
